# Vehicle Maintenance KMP

A Kotlin Multiplatform app for searching and registering vehicle maintenance history, built as a professional portfolio project focused on modern mobile architecture, backend integration, and an incremental offline-first strategy.

The goal of this repository is not to showcase the largest possible number of libraries. The goal is to build a coherent, sustainable, production-inspired mobile codebase: shared UI with Compose Multiplatform, predictable state management, local persistence, shared networking, and pragmatic synchronization.

## Status

This project is under active development.

Currently implemented:

- Kotlin Multiplatform targeting Android and iOS.
- Shared UI with Compose Multiplatform.
- Shared navigation.
- Dependency injection with Koin.
- Shared networking with Ktor Client.
- Local persistence with Room Multiplatform.
- Initial vehicle search flow.
- Local vehicle registration.
- Local maintenance registration.
- Local-first reads for vehicles and maintenance records.
- Initial best-effort sync for pending records.
- Shared ViewModel tests.

Not implemented yet:

- Full login/JWT flow.
- Real backend integration.
- Image upload.
- Robust outbox with retry/backoff.
- Mobile observability.
- Conflict resolution.

These items are part of the incremental roadmap.

## Domain

The app models a simple and realistic vehicle maintenance history flow:

1. The user searches by license plate.
2. The app reads from the local database first.
3. The network layer tries to synchronize the latest data.
4. If the vehicle exists, the app displays vehicle details and maintenance history.
5. If the vehicle does not exist, the user can register a new vehicle.
6. The user can register maintenance records locally.
7. Offline operations remain pending until a future synchronization.

The expected backend is a Java Spring Boot microservices architecture using REST APIs, JWT, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Docker, and OpenAPI.

## Architecture

The current architecture uses pragmatic feature-based organization, with clear layers and no unnecessary abstractions:

```text
composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/mmetzner/vehiclemaintenance
+-- core
|   +-- database
|   +-- di
|   +-- navigation
|   +-- network
|   +-- util
+-- feature
    +-- vehicle
        +-- data
        |   +-- local
        |   |   +-- dao
        |   |   +-- entity
        |   +-- mapper
        |   +-- remote
        |       +-- dto
        +-- domain
        |   +-- model
        |   +-- repository
        +-- presentation
            +-- addmaintenance
            +-- addvehicle
            +-- search
```

### Layers

`presentation`

Contains Compose screens, ViewModels, and UI state. The UI observes `StateFlow` and sends explicit events to ViewModels.

`domain`

Contains feature models and contracts. This layer is intentionally lightweight because the project does not yet need a large use case hierarchy.

`data`

Coordinates local persistence, remote calls, and mapping. The repository is the main offline-first orchestration boundary.

`core`

Contains shared infrastructure: database, dependency injection, navigation, networking, and multiplatform utilities.

## Offline-First Strategy

The offline-first strategy is being built incrementally.

Current decision:

- The local database is the primary source of truth for reads.
- Vehicle search observes local data through `Flow`.
- Network synchronization updates local data.
- New records are persisted locally with `SyncStatus.PENDING`.
- The app attempts to synchronize pending records in the background using a best-effort approach.

This already exercises a local-first flow without introducing a complex sync engine too early.

Planned evolution:

- Introduce a dedicated outbox for pending operations.
- Store operation type, payload, retry count, error, and timestamps.
- Implement retry with backoff.
- Separate manual sync from automatic sync.
- Add connectivity awareness.
- Add a dedicated queue for image uploads.
- Represent sync states such as `PENDING`, `SYNCING`, `SYNCED`, and `FAILED`.

At this stage, the project intentionally avoids heavier solutions such as event sourcing, CRDTs, or a generic conflict engine. For this domain, simple eventual consistency and backend idempotency are more realistic choices.

## Networking

Networking is shared in `commonMain` using Ktor Client.

The base URL configuration uses `expect/actual`:

- Android Emulator: `http://10.0.2.2:8080`
- iOS Simulator: `http://localhost:8080`

Vehicle API calls go through `VehicleRemoteDataSource`, keeping endpoint details out of the repository.

Current structure:

```text
core/network
+-- ApiConfig.kt
+-- createHttpClient.kt

feature/vehicle/data/remote
+-- VehicleRemoteDataSource.kt
+-- dto
    +-- VehicleResponse.kt
    +-- MaintenanceResponse.kt
```

## Local Persistence

The project uses Room Multiplatform with the bundled SQLite driver.

Current entities:

- `VehicleEntity`
- `MaintenanceEntity`
- `MaintenancePhotoEntity`

Relationships:

- A vehicle has many maintenance records.
- A maintenance record has many photos.

Entities already carry `syncStatus`, preparing the codebase for a more robust offline-first sync flow.

## Technical Decisions

### Room Multiplatform Instead of SQLDelight

Room Multiplatform reduces friction for developers coming from Android and keeps a familiar DAO/entity/relationship model.

Trade-off:

- Good for productivity and readability for Android reviewers.
- Less explicit than SQLDelight for SQL control and manual migration design.

### Shared Compose Multiplatform UI

The UI lives in `commonMain`, allowing screens and state handling to be reused across Android and iOS.

Trade-off:

- Excellent for demonstrating real KMP usage.
- Requires care with native UX expectations and platform-specific limitations.

### Repository as the Main Boundary

The project does not introduce interfaces for every data source at this stage. The main feature contract is the repository.

Trade-off:

- Less boilerplate.
- Simpler architecture.
- Deeper sync tests may justify additional abstractions later.

### Use Cases on Demand

Use cases will be introduced only when business logic is significant enough to justify a dedicated layer.

At this stage, creating one use case per repository call would be architecture theater rather than a practical need.

## Running the Project

Prerequisites:

- Recent Android Studio version with Kotlin Multiplatform support.
- JDK compatible with the Android Gradle Plugin.
- Xcode for iOS builds.
- Local backend running on port `8080` when real integration is available.

Build Android:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :composeApp:assembleDebug
```

Compile Android Kotlin and run shared tests:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :composeApp:compileDebugKotlinAndroid :composeApp:allTests
```

Run iOS:

Open the `iosApp` project in Xcode and run it on a simulator.

## Tests

The project has tests in `commonTest`, covering ViewModel behavior and the initial local-first flow.

Examples:

- When local cache exists, search shows success even if the network fails.
- When there is no local cache and the network fails, search shows an error.
- Valid vehicle input is saved through the repository and emits a navigation event.
- Invalid input does not trigger saving.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Incremental evolution of a KMP app.
- Clear separation between UI, domain, and data.
- Pragmatic use of modern mobile architecture.
- Offline-first thinking from the beginning.
- Backend integration readiness for Java Spring Boot.
- Awareness of portfolio vs production trade-offs.
- Real multiplatform care, including Android/iOS differences.

## Current Limitations

- Synchronization does not yet have persistent retry.
- Sync failures are not yet richly exposed to the UI.
- Token storage has not been implemented yet.
- The networking layer does not yet support refresh tokens.
- Image upload is currently only represented in the local data model.
- The real backend is not connected yet.

These limitations are intentional so the project remains incremental and reviewable.
